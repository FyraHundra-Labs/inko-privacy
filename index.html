<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective date: February 15, 2026</p>

<p>Inko ("we", "our", "the app") is a daily check-in app that helps you stay connected with your circle. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Account data</strong> — When you sign up, we collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your phone number (used for authentication via SMS)</li>
  <li>Your timezone (auto-detected from your device)</li>
  <li>Your preferred language</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Check-in data</strong> — Each day, when you check in, we store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The emoji(s) you selected (up to 3)</li>
  <li>The date and time of your check-in</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Connections</strong> — When you add people to your circle, we store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The phone number of the person you added</li>
  <li>The name/alias you gave them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Device data</strong> — To send push notifications, we store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your Expo push notification token</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contacts (optional, read-only)</strong> — If you choose to import contacts, we temporarily read your device's contact list to find people already on Inko. We do not upload or store your full contact list on our servers. Only the phone numbers you explicitly add to your circle are stored.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Your phone number is used to verify your identity via SMS one-time passwords.</li>
  <li><strong>Check-ins:</strong> Your emoji selections are shared with people in your circle so they can see that you've checked in.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> We send push notifications to remind you to check in and to let you know when your circle is complete.</li>
  <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Phone numbers of your connections are used to link you with other Inko users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Who Can See Your Data</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your circle:</strong> People you've added to your circle can see your daily emoji, check-in time, and whether you're on vacation. They cannot see your phone number or settings.</li>
  <li><strong>People who added you:</strong> If someone adds your phone number to their circle and you're an Inko user, they can see your daily check-in status.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not sell your data. We do not share your data with advertisers.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — Our backend provider. Stores your account data, check-ins, and connections in a PostgreSQL database. Handles SMS authentication. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase Privacy Policy</a></li>
  <li><strong>Expo</strong> — Used to deliver push notifications to your device. <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">Expo Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your account data and check-in history are retained as long as your account exists.</li>
  <li>If you delete your account (via Settings), all your data is permanently deleted from our servers, including check-in logs and connection records.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>

<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delete your account</strong> at any time from Settings. This permanently removes all your data.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove connections</strong> from your circle at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Block users</strong> to prevent them from adding you to their circle.</li>
  <li><strong>Request your data</strong> by contacting us at the email below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Inko does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has created an account, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>

<p>All data is transmitted over HTTPS. Database access is protected by row-level security policies. Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
